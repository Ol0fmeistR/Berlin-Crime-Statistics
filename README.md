### Interactive Multipage Dashboard Using Dash <br>

Dash is a python framework created by plotly for creating interactive web applications. It is written on top of Flask, Plotly.js and React.js <br>
With dash apps it becomes easier for data scientists and engineers to put complex Python analytics in the hands of business decision makers and operators. <br>

This dashboard keeps track of the crime statistics from 2012-19 across the various districts of Berlin, Germany. The dashboard has been hosted using Heroku, and you
can access it <a href="https://python-dashboard-dash.herokuapp.com/">here</a> <br>

Feel free to fork/download and add your own features. For starters, the email functionality of the feedback form can be implemented. An easy solution for this would 
be to use Gmail's SMTP but you would have to set your gmail account to accept emails from less secure sources. The about page can also be implemented if you want, I
just felt too lazy.
